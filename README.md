This is a sequential model I built to predict the values of income based on selected features

I used Keras Sequential model to achive this with 3 layers two of which had 64 nodes and third have 32 nodes. 

I would like to give credit to this tutorial as it gave me get support to build the model:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression

I achived a RSME of 61,234 on my final submission.
